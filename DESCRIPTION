Description: miRDriver identifies frequently aberrated regions using GISTIC and computes differentially expressed genes between the two patient groups as 
             frequently aberrated group and non-aberrated group. Utilizing copy number aberration, DNA methylation, gene expression, transcription factor expression and 
             miRNA expression datasets, miRDriver applies a LASSO-based method to select miRNA-target gene interactions.
