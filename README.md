# miRDriver
miRDriver identifies frequently aberrated regions using GISTIC and computes differentially expressed genes between the two patient groups as frequently aberrated group and not frequently aberrated group. Utilizing copy number aberration, DNA methylation, gene expression, transcription factor expression and miRNA expression datasets, miRDriver applies a LASSO-based method to select miRNAs-target gene interactions. We tested miRDriver on breast cancer and ovarian cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database.
