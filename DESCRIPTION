Description: The miRDriver package is designed for easy use and implementaion. It identifies frequently aberrated regions using GISTIC and computes differentially expressed genes between the two patient groups as 
             frequently aberrated group and non-aberrated group. Utilizing copy number aberration, DNA methylation, gene expression, transcription factor expression and 
             miRNA expression datasets, miRDriver applies a LASSO-based method to select miRNA-target gene interactions.
